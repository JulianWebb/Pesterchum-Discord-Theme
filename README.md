# Pestercord (4/13/2022 Edition) ‚ú®

This is a **[BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/)** theme that emulates the look and feel of the chat client, **[Pesterchum](https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Chat_client#Pesterchum)**, shown within the webcomic **[Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com/)**. Supports both Dark and Light theme (Light Mode is preferred).

## How does it work? üîß
Through a rather convoluted and arcane process, you must first install BetterDiscord.
1.  Download the installer [here](https://github.com/BetterDiscord/Installer/releases/latest)  and open it.
2.  Agree to the license.
3.  Select "Install BetterDiscord" from the list of options.
4.  Choose your current discord build.
5.  Click the "Install" button, and discord should restart with BetterDiscord installed.

Then, an additional hoop must be jumped through. But only one.

 1. Near the top of this page, click **Code**.
 2.  Click the "Download as Zip" button to do exactly that. Download it anywhere you will remember to fetch it later.
 3. Ensure you have BetterDiscord installed. If you don't, refer to the first step of the first sequence.
 4. Open your Discord user settings. Near the very bottom, there should be a "Themes" tab. Usually above "Change Log" and "HypeSquad." Click it.
 5. At the top of the themes page, click the "Open themes folder" button.
 6. Drag the .zip you download into the themes folder that opened. 
 7. Extract the contents to that folder and delete the original .zip file. 
 8. Pester your friends. 8e the 8itch.

## What's new? üîç
Frankly, very little from the original master. A few small fixes have been implemented, including:

 - **General compatibility with BetterDiscord version 1.5.2.** It is unknown if upcoming updates may break the theme again, but it is unlikely this will happen for a while (or long enough for you to not have to worry about coming back here for a fix).
	 - The home/private and group chat icon has been restored to the Pesterchum logo. 
	 - The chat background for Dark Mode has been restored to a sleek, sexy, oil-like black. 
	 - The window accent at the top left has been restored from "Discord" to "Pesterchum."
	 - The text box has been made to match the chat background color.
	 - Other under-the-hood fixes. We can't tell you what they are because this is supposed to be a cheeky changelog that doesn't really give you much more information to work with. And we're sticking to the bit.
 - **Two small improvements.** So small you might not notice them, but noticeable enough to make the experience just that little bit better.
	 - Improved color clarity across multiple in-app labels and chat accents.
	 - The typing indicator now appears in black for both Light Mode and Dark Mode. Because white on yellow is fairly hard to read.
 - **Some extra goodies.** These weren't part of the original master, but we think you'll like them.
	 - "Friends" above "Nitro" now reads "Chums."
	 - The "Add Friend" button on the Friends page now reads "Add Chum."
	 - "Direct Messages" has been changed to "Chumroll."
	 - All buttons on the Friends page now emulate the buttons from the original Pesterchum 6.0 client.
	 - Header text, status icons and miscellaneous buttons near the top right are now black for easier readability against a brighter yellow. Works for both Light and Dark Mode.
